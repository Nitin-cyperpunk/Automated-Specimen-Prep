    {
      question: "Do I need internet?",
      answer: "No. Core functions run 100% offline; cloud only for optional backups and analytics."
    },
    {
      question: "Can it cut steel-wire armoured cables?",
      answer: "Yes â€“ swap to tungsten blade profile; AI adjusts speed to 4 mm/s automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the camera lens fogs?",
      answer: "Humidity sensor triggers air-knife + heater; batch paused until clear. The system automatically resumes when conditions are optimal."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the AI vision system?",
      answer: "Our AI achieves 98.7% mAP@0.5 on material detection and Â±0.05mm precision on dimensional measurements, trained on 42,000 labeled images."
    },
    {
      question: "What standards does it comply with?",
      answer: "Fully compliant with IS 10810 (all parts) and IS 7098 specifications. Auto-generated reports are legally valid digital records per IT Act 2000."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does calibration take?",
      answer: "Automatic calibration runs in under 3 minutes using NIST-traceable checkerboard + laser distance sensor. Triggers every 24h or on 5Â°C temperature change."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I integrate with existing LIMS/ERP systems?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide REST APIs, MQTT broker plug-ins, and pre-built connectors for SAP S/4, LabView, and Siemens TIA Portal."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the blade life expectancy?",
      answer: "Predictive LSTM model provides remaining useful life estimation with 2.1h RMSE. Typical blade life: 800-1200 specimens depending on material."
    },
    {
      question: "How is data security handled?",
      answer: "SOC-2 Type II certified with AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, RBAC with LDAP sync, and immutable audit logs for 7 years."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run this completely offline/air-gapped?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide an 8GB offline bundle with all models and dependencies. Updates via USB once per quarter for air-gapped environments."
